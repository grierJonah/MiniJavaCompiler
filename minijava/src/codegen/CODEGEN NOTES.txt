Unfortunately I wasn't able to get to doing all parts of the code generation. In the current build, 
I am able to produce assembly code for a simple print, and addition of two numbers. While I can reproduce stable
assembly in my own .S file through emacs, I found it especially challenging to get the visitor classes to output 
the correct ordering. Additionally, I had some trouble solving how to fix 'overwriting' to a file.
